# FancyBox Extension for Flarum

Image formatting and lightbox modal using FancyBox.

For more information about FancyBox, see: https://fancyapps.com/fancybox

## Features

 - Clicking on an image in a post launches the FancyBox modal. This allows users
to zoom in on the image, pan around, and navigate among multiple images on the
same post as a gallery.
- Images are displayed with formatting to normalize sizes and layout.
- If the author of the post has wrapped the image in a link, it will be shown
as an external link. (Clicking on the image will not launch the FancyBox modal
in this case.)

Note: this extension does not generate thumbnails. The sorage location of
images, and the file size / bandwidth usage are not affected.

## Installation

This repository will soon be on Packagist, meaning that it will be able to be
installed via a `composer` command. Stay tuned.
